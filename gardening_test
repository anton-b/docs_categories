August is a great time to sow seeds and plant young plants in the UK. On the vegetable patch, sowing and planting out now will keep your cropping season going, providing you with short-term harvests of salad leaves and other quick-growing crops such as radishes, along with longer-cropping plants like winter cabbages. For veg that need a bit of time to crop well, planting in August will ensure plants get plenty of sunshine and warm temperatures before autumn sets in.

In ornamental borders and cuttings patches, August is a great time to get ahead and plan for the following year. Sowing hardy annuals now will give you an early crop of flowers in spring, while biennials sown in August will flower by the following summer.

Bear in mind that, while warm August temperatures are perfect for aiding seed germination, the water table is lower so you may need to provide additional water to seedlings and newly planted plants. During periods of dry weather or drought, be aware that you may need to reduce your water use in the garden.

Vegetables to plant in August
Lettuce

Hardier than they look, lettuces can be overwintered in greenhouses and beneath cloches, for picking leaves from April through to June.

Young spinach leaves
Sown in late August, spinach can provide a crop of young leaves in October and then enter dormancy over winter, ready to provide a fresh crop of leaves in early spring. survive harsh frosts and rain. Sow direct in well-prepared, fertile soil, and cover with a low cloche when temperatures start to fall.

Oriental leaves

Oriental leaves growing out
Fast germination makes oriental leaves satisfying to sow, whether direct in soil or in modules for planting out. The latter method works better in wet summers (slugs may eat rows of seedlings in a night). Sow three seeds per module, and thin to one or two plants. Cover with a cloche as temperatures begin to fall in autumn.

Rocket
56005
Rocket plants
Wild rocket sown in early August will provide you with a crop of fresh leaves before winter, and then lie dormant until March, when it will put on new growth. Salad rocket stands the best chance of surviving frosts if sown in late August. It also offers more leaves in winter than wild rocket, but often bolts in April.

Corn salad

Young corn salad (lamb's lettuce) plants in modules
Corn salad is a delicious leaf crop that crops throughout winter. Sow direct in well-prepared soil and cover with a cloche when temperatures start to drop. Corn salad roots are shallow, so water regularly if under cover or in otherwise dry conditions.

Spring onions

Freshly harvested spring onions
Onions don't germinate well in temperatures regularly above 20°C, so bear this in mind when sowing in August. Either sow direct in rows outdoors, with seed covered by 2cm of soil, or in modules, with up to 10 seeds in each, for a harvestable 'clump' in spring.

Turnips

Turnips are best sown direct and then thinned. Sow seeds sparingly because, although they're tiny, they all seem to germinate and subsequent growth is rapid. Thin in late August or early September. Module-sown seed can be thinned to two or three roots in each, for planting out in late August. Fleece or mesh help keep pigeons, butterflies and cabbage root fly at bay.

Spring cabbages can be sown direct outdoors, or indoors in modules to be planted out later, while winter cabbages grown from seed in previous months should be planted out now. Protect from cabbage white caterpillars and pigeons using fine netting suspended 1m off the ground to protect hedgehogs, or a bespoke cage.
