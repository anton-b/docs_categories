Begonia plug plants are an easy and economical way of quickly filling your containers and baskets with huge flowers. Smaller plug plants are best potted up and grown on, but jumbo plugs or garden-ready plants can go straight into their final containers after all risk of frost has passed.

Begonia plants are a fantastic addition to beds, borders, baskets, Flower Pouches® and just about any patio container you can think of! Producing a long-lasting display of bright and showy flowers, begonia plants keep going until the first frosts.

Petunia plug plants are easy to grow on, and provide a rewarding display in beds, containers, hanging baskets and Flower Pouches®. Trailing Petunia plants such as the Surfinia varieties are our most popular, but there are plenty of other unusual and eye-catching varieties available. These half-hardy annuals look spectacular spilling from hanging baskets and containers, or planted en masse in flower beds where they keep flowering until the first frosts.

Fuchsia plug plants are an elegant addition to summer hanging baskets and containers, and most varieties are cold hardy too. Trailing fuchsia plugs can be transplanted straight into hanging baskets and containers for instant impact, while climbing and upright varieties can be positioned for maximum impact. Available in a range of colours, fuchsias are a great way to brighten up corners of the garden that experience part or dappled shade.

Dianthus plants, also known as carnations, pinks and sweet Williams (Dianthus barbatus), can take a whole year to flower from seed! For quick and instant results start with dianthus plug plants. Once potted up, your plugs will quickly start to flower and return year after year.

These hardy perennials are cottage garden essentials and perfect for the front of sunny borders where they add both colour and fragrance. Dianthus flowers are also superb for cutting, lasting many weeks in a vase.

5. Geranium plug plants

Tender geranium plants (pelargoniums) are slow to grow from seed, requiring many months of nurturing. Geranium cuttings require over-wintering, which takes up lots of space and time. Geranium plug plants are a much easier alternative - their strong growth will quickly fill out beds, hanging baskets and patio containers with clear, vibrant colour.

With a wide range from which to choose including trailing, climbing, upright and unique rosebud varieties like ‘Appleblossom Rosebud’, you’re sure to find a pelargonium to suit your needs. Check out our guide to growing geraniums from plugs to get yours off to the best start.

6. Pansy plug plants

Pansy plug plants and violas, their smaller relatives, give months of pleasure in beds, borders and containers. Winter-flowering pansies inject a welcome splash of colour when most other plants are dormant, making an invaluable addition to autumn, winter and early spring container displays. Save yourself the hassle of growing pansies from seed and order value-for-money plug plants for a quick and easy display!

Wallflower plug plants are a popular cottage garden favourite, valued for their fragrance and range of vibrant spring colours. Most often treated as biennials, wallflower seeds need sowing a year in advance, and the seedlings require nurturing and potting on through the hottest months of the year.

Wallflower plug plants are a much easier way to quickly fill your beds, borders and patio containers with low-maintenance colour, taking all the hassle out of growing these gorgeous flowers. Happy in even the poorest of soils, wallflowers are a versatile and undemanding addition to your garden!

With a range of bush and cordon varieties, you can grow tomatoes in a greenhouse, vegetable bed, patio containers or even hanging baskets! Take a look at our How to grow tomatoes article for more growing information or check out our dedicated tomato hub page.
